# Artificial-Intelligence

# Project 1: 
In this project informed, uninformed and local search algorithms were built
and applied to Pacman environment. Files containing my implementations are **search.py, searchAgents.py, solveEightQueens.py**
Following solutions and answers to questions were implemented:
1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. Varying the Cost Function
(Uniform Cost Search)
4. A* Search
5. Representation for Corners
Problem
6. Heuristics for Corners
Problem
7. Food Heuristic

# Project 2: 
In this project various AI techniques for Pacman and
Tic-Tac-Toe were implemented. Files containing my implementations are **multiAgents.py, solveTicTacToe.py**
Following solutions and answers to questions were implemented:
1. Reflex Agent
2. Minimax
3. Alpha-Beta Pruning
4. Expectimax
5. Better Evaluation Function
6. 3-Board Misere Tic-Tac-Toe(Notakto)

# Project 3:
This project presents my implementation for value iteration and Q-learning. They were tested in different environments: grid, a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and
Pacman. Files containing my implementations are **valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py and analysis.py**.
Following solutions and answers to questions were implemented:
1. Value Iteration
2. Bridge Crossing Analysis
3. Policies
4. Q-Learning
5. Epsilon Greedy
6. Bridge Crossing Revisited
7. Q-Learning and Pacman
8. Approximate Q-Learning

# Project 4:
In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency. Files containing my implementations are **bustersAgents.py and inference.py**.
Following solutions and answers to questions were implemented:
1. Exact Inference Observation
2. Exact Inference with Time Elapse
3. Exact Inference Full Test
4. Approximate Inference Observation
5. Approximate Inference with Time Elapse
6. Joint Particle Filter Observation
7. Joint Particle Filter with Elapse Time
